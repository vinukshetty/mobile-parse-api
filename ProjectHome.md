# Overview #

http://www.parse.com offers great features and a list of API libraries (See: https://www.parse.com/docs/api_libraries).

This library implements the REST API of parse.com in java with open interfaces for libgdx (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and playN (http://code.google.com/p/playn/). It also contains a simple java implementation, which can be used for testing.


# Getting started #

  * check out the source code (sorry currently no maven repository)
  * import the projects in eclpise (or your favourite IDE)
  * create an account on "www.parse.com"
  * set your application id and rest api key in "parse.properties"
  * run the unit test to see how it works.
